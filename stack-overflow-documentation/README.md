## Calculating Selector Specificity

> <code>
Each individual CSS Selector has its own specificity value. Every selector in a sequence increases the sequence's overall specificity. Selectors fall into one of three different specificity groups: *A*, *B* and *c*. When multiple selector sequences select a given element, the browser uses the styles applied by the sequence with the highest overall specificity.
